# Platt Electric Supply

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Things I would like to improve upon

* The CSS needs vendor prefixing.
* CSS can be cut down quite a bit by re-using styles.
* Javascript can be further componentized into smaller reusable components.
* Search / Autocomplete needs to be beefed up.
* Images need alt tags to improve seo.
* Images also need to be compressed.
